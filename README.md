## Code examples 
I have included code written for the assignments and exams I undertook as part of a 16-week software engineering course.

I have also included CodeWars challenges that I have completed. These are individual problems ranked in levels of increasing difficulty (where 8kyu problems are the least difficult).


## Other 
A group project was also required for this course. As it was a collaborative effort and therefore does not contain code solely written by me, I have chosen not to share it for the interview.
However, the repository for the project, 'Dogtective', is public and I have forked the repository.
