# About Me!

---

## My name is Iman :) 

**I'm 23 and I'm from London**

I currently live in Bristol, where I work as a technician in a lab.

### Previous coding experience 
* I have some experience with Python, and I am looking forward to doing more of it!
* I completed an intro to SQL course with Code First Girls last year
* I have used and taken classed for R as part of my job due to the analytical nature of my job

I am *not* proficient in any of these languages, but I am very excited to learn more 

### What will I use GitHub and Git for?
>Both are very powerful tools needed to create and carry out collaborative projects. 
> This is what I will use them for throughout the CFGDegree as evidence of what I've learnt 


# Assignment Questions!

---

## What is .gitignore and what is it used for?

>This tells your version control (VS) what *not* to track

This is needed for any repository you make

## What is requirements.txt?
>This is a list of packages/libraries required for a project


These packages and libraries can be installed in the requirements.txt file 
This is to ensure a consistent environment 

# Screenshots Assignment 1

---

In order they appear in directory
1. Making my repository
2. Evidence of .gitignore file
3. requirement.txt in Assignment1 directory and commit with meaningful message
4. git commit with meaningful message and git status carried out in terminal 
5. https to ssh key (forgot to make SSH key at start of course)
 Rest of screenshots are for PR evidence
